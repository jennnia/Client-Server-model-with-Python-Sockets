# Client-Server-model-with-Python-Sockets

ðŸŒŸ This project demonstrates the client-server model using Python sockets. It involves two scripts: one for the client and one for the server. The client connects to the server over a specified port, sends a message, and waits for a response. The server listens for incoming connections, receives messages from the client, sends a response, and then closes the connection. The project showcases basic network communication, error handling, and socket programming in Python.
